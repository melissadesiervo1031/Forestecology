This data file (“Jules et al. Klamath Mtn Tree Data 06 24 2021.csv”) includes data from 148 plots surveyed in the Russian Wilderness of northern California (USA). Data on tree species cover was collected from each plot in 1969 and 2015. 

Data column information:
1. Plot number column includes the plot number and year (1969 or 2015).
2. The column labelled Year is either 1969 or 2015, the two years of the survey.
3. Elev(dem) is the elevation of each plot in meters.
4. “heatload” is the heatload index, a proxy for solar radiation based on aspect, slope, and topographic position in the context of surrounding landscape (defined in McCune 2007).
